# Gender Classification

## Overview
This is a simple implementation of machine learning using scikit-learn module in Python. It uses a small data set of physical measurements (height, weight, and shoe size) labeled as male or female so that we can predict someone's gender by their measurements.

Here, I use three classifiers from the scikit-learn module: decision tree, random forest, and k-nearest neighbors with their default values.
